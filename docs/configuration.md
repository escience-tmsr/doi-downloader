# Configuration

Certain plugins might require configuration to work properly. These parameters can be saved in a `.env` file in the root of your project. `test.env` shows a test env file.
This can be compied to a `.env` file. Example of a parameter that needs to be set is an email address for the Unpaywall plugin. Develpong new plugins with API key access would also require
an API key to be set in the `.env` file.
